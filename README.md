Vertically Integrated Transient Flow and Transport  Solver

This aims to solve the vertically integrated groundwater flow equation 
and a dissolved contaminant transport equation. 
The tasks to be performed are:

1. Update old flow solver in OOP framework
- Create testing framework using python's unittest module
- Test flow solver
2. Add contaminant transport solver to the system. 
- create new solver using upstream weighting.
- test solver using unittest.

The following is a sketch of the class heirarchy.
